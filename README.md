# Weird A.I. Yankovic

Weird A.I. Yankovic is a neural network based lyric generation system. Given a syllable and rhyme scheme, it attempts to generate new lyrics that fit that scheme.

The intended use is to generate new lyrics for existing songs by feeding in the syllable and rhyme scheme for the song and then some contextualization information.

It does not sing or match the lyrics to the music. You have to do that yourself. To make that easier, there are routines at the end for creating a karaoke video.

This system was developed by Mark Riedl. The work was performed independently of the Georgia Institute of Technology and released under MIT License.

The system runs on Google Colab. Open the ```weirdai.ipyp``` file and click the "Open In Colab" button.
